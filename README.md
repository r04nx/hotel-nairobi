    <h1>Hotel Nairobi Project</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Hotel Nairobi project, a static website built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides an opportunity for developers to test their skills in front-end development, specifically in the areas of user interface design, responsive web design, and web accessibility.</p>
    <p>The website features a simple and elegant design that allows users to navigate easily and access important information about the hotel. The website includes a login and signup page, as well as a homepage that provides an overview of the hotel and its amenities.</p>
    <p>Although the website does not include any backend functionality, it is still a great opportunity for developers to practice their skills in front-end development. Working on this project will provide you with the opportunity to hone your skills in responsive web design, user interface design, and web accessibility.</p>
    <p>Whether you are just starting out as a developer or looking to improve your existing skills, the Hotel Nairobi project is a great way to practice your front-end development skills.</p>
